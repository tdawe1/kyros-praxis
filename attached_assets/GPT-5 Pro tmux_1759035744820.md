Thought for 19s

Here’s a 2,500-char copy-paste build prompt for Bubble to scaffold a Kyros Demo Platform (not a website) that showcases your products with reliable, scripted demos.

Title: Kyros Demo Platform (condensed)

Goal: Password-gated, brand-consistent demo app to show Reporting/Scheduler + Assistant, and preview Agent Console, GengoWatcher, and Multi-LLM Translation Assistant.

Brand: Monochrome UI with electric-blue accents; Inter/Space Grotesk; accessible focus states.

Data types:
RunStatus (pending/running/success/warning/failed);
Lead(name,email,company,notes,ts);
DemoSession(tenant_id,scenario,flags,last_reset);
ReportDefinition(title,description,query); Schedule(report,cron,next_run,active); ReportRun(report,status,start,finish,rows,output_url,log,error);
AssistantTask(prompt,status,plan_json,start,finish); PlanStep(task,idx,title,status,details);
OrchestratorPlan(run_id,task,steps_json,created_at); RunHistoryEvent(run_id,ts,actor,message,severity).

Workflows:

Run simulator: append log lines with short delays; set status; write ReportRun/AssistantTask.

Scheduler preview: given cron/preset, compute next 5 run times (approx).

LeadModal: capture UTM + page; write Lead + EventLog.

Reset demo: purge tenant data, reseed samples.

Seed data:

Reporting: 3 reports (Revenue by Channel, Top Products, Margin Trend) + 15 mixed history rows.

Assistant: 2 canned tasks (“weekly marketing report”, “inventory quote helper”).

Agent Console: 1 plan w/ 6 steps + 12 history events.

Below are three separate ≤2,500‑character prompts you can paste into Bubble’s builder—one per page. Each builds a slick, simulated demo with an “Email us to customise with real APIs” CTA.

Prompt 1 — Translation Lab (Watcher + Translation Tools + Multi‑LLM)

Create page /translation-lab. Goal: simulate end‑to‑end flow from incoming jobs (RSS/WebSocket‑like feed) to document translation with SIMPLE / PARALLEL / CRITIQUE modes. No external calls; deterministic fake data.
Design: Monochrome + electric‑blue accents; two‑pane layout (left feed, right workspace).
Data (option sets/types): RunStatus(pending,running,success,warning,failed); Mode(simple,parallel,critique). TranslationJob(filename,mode,status,primary_model,start,finish,steps_json,qa_flags_json,output_url). WatcherEvent(ts,channel(“rss”|“websocket”),title,reward,url).
UI:
• Left: “Live feed” list of WatcherEvents with badges (rss/websocket), wstest button injects a test event.
• Right (workspace): Upload control (.docx/.pptx/.xlsx) + sample picker; Mode select; Primary model select; Process button.
• Progress timeline: connect → parse → plan → translate → QA → package.
• QA flags panel (e.g., residual‑JP, overflow, style‑loss); Log drawer with auto‑scroll.
• Actions: Download sample output (static file), View plan JSON, Reset demo.
Workflows:
On Process → create TranslationJob; stream 5–7 log lines with short delays; generate mode‑specific QA flags; set status success/warning per seeded rule; attach static output_url. wstest just adds a WatcherEvent row.
CTA: Button “Email us to customise this with your feeds + LLMs” → opens mailto:hello@kyros.solutions and logs Event “contact_click”.

Prompt 2 — Reporting Studio (Marketing Dashboard)

Create page /reporting. Goal: simulated marketing performance hub with KPIs, charts, scheduler, and run history. No external calls.
Data: MetricDay(date,channel,impressions,clicks,sessions,leads,cost,revenue). ReportRun(status,start,finish,rows,log,report_name). Schedule(preset or cron,next_run,active).
UI:
• Filters: date range, channel multi‑select.
• KPI tiles: Sessions, Leads, Cost, Revenue, CAC(cost/leads), ROAS(revenue/cost).
• Charts: Line (revenue over time), Bar (top channels by leads), Pie (spend split).
• Scheduler card: presets (Daily 08:00 / Hourly / Weekly Mon 09:00) or cron; show Next 5 run times.
• Run History table with status pills and log modal.
• Actions: Run now (simulate), Email me this (no send; just toast).
Workflows:
Seed ~180 MetricDay rows across 3–4 channels; compute KPIs client‑side. Run now creates ReportRun → stream logs (connect→query→aggregate→render) → success with fake row count. Scheduler preview computes next 5 times from preset/cron (approx).
CTA: Footer bar “Email us to connect your GA/ads/CRM and schedule real runs” → mailto:hello@kyros.solutions + event log.

Prompt 3 — Quoting Tool (Inventory Match + Margins + Follow‑ups)

Create page /quoting. Goal: generate professional quotes with real‑time inventory matching, margin calculations, and automated follow‑ups—all simulated.
Data: Product(sku,name,cost,price,stock,alt_skus_json). Quote(id,customer_name,email,company,status(draft,sent,accepted,expired),subtotal,tax,shipping,total,margin_pct,created_at,expires_at,pdf_url,followup_plan_json). QuoteItem(quote,sku,qty,unit_cost,unit_price,line_total,margin_pct,in_stock).
UI (3‑step wizard):

Customer: name,email,company; expiry date auto +14d.

Items: typeahead SKU search shows stock and warnings; suggest alternatives from alt_skus if low stock; quantity picker; Auto‑price = cost × margin rule by tier; highlight margin heatmap.

Review & Send: totals (subtotal,tax,shipping,total), margin %, delivery ETA from stock; buttons Generate PDF (static), Send quote (sim toast), Schedule follow‑ups (e.g., T+2, T+7 with statuses).
Workflows:
Auto‑recalc totals and margins on edit; “Send quote” sets status=sent and creates followup_plan_json; “Accept” toggles accepted; “Out of stock” suggests alt_skus.
CTA: Banner “Email us to connect ERP/CRM, live stock & e‑sign” → mailto:hello@kyros.solutions + event log.

Below is a single follow‑up implementation + QA prompt you can hand to your builder. It reiterates required features, adds a few missing pieces, and defines acceptance criteria so the demo is airtight. It’s platform‑agnostic and uses simulated data only.

Kyros Demo Platform — Follow‑Up Implementation & QA Prompt

Objective: Deliver a slick, reliable demo with three experiences—Translation Lab, Reporting Studio, Quoting Tool—that tells a 5–10 minute story end‑to‑end using simulated data only. Each page must include a persistent CTA: “Email us and we’ll customise this with your real tools & APIs.” (mailto:hello@kyros.solutions or contact form that logs an event).

Global (applies to all pages)

Brand/UI: Minimalist monochrome with an electric‑blue accent; responsive; keyboard‑navigable; WCAG 2.1 AA.

Demo Guardrails: No external calls. A Demo Admin panel (hidden) exposes: Reset Data, Time‑lapse speed, Inject Failure/Warning toggles.

Simulation Engine: Deterministic streams (seeded RNG) that “play” logs/steps; finish states = success/warning/failure per toggle.

Telemetry: Log view, filter_change, run_start, run_finish, cta_click, reset_demo.

Reset: Wipes tenant/session data and reseeds within 2 seconds; show toast on completion.

Copy: UK tone; absolute dates; currency defaults to GBP.

1) Translation Lab (Watcher + Translation Tools + Multi‑LLM)

Goal: Show intake → processing → QA → packaged output without hitting real feeds/models.

Required features

Live Feed (left rail): Simulated “incoming jobs” list with source badges (RSS/WebSocket), reward/priority, and a wstest button that injects a diagnostic job.

Workspace (right): Upload picker (.docx/.pptx/.xlsx) and sample selector; Mode = SIMPLE / PARALLEL / CRITIQUE; Primary model selector (labels only).

Process run: Timeline (connect → parse → plan → translate → QA → package) with streamed logs.

QA flags: Residual‑language, overflow, inline‑style loss, glossary match rate. Each flag shows short guidance.

Artifacts: “View plan JSON”, “Download sample output” (static), and “Open log drawer” (auto‑scroll).

Failure/Warning paths: If “Inject Failure” is on, stop at QA with an error message and remediation hint.

CTA: “Email us to plug in your feeds + LLMs” (mailto + telemetry).

Acceptance criteria

Process completes < 10s in normal speed; < 3s in time‑lapse.

Mode switches affect flags and logs deterministically.

wstest adds a feed item instantly; feed supports pause/resume.

All actions are keyboard‑accessible; Escape closes modals.

Nice‑to‑add (still simulated)

Side‑by‑side diff preview for a few sample sentences.

Toggle: Mask numbers/URLs to demonstrate QA benefit.

2) Reporting Studio (Marketing Dashboard)

Goal: Show metrics, filterable charts, scheduler preview, and auditable run history.

Required features

Filters: Date range, multi‑select Channel (e.g., Paid, Organic, Email, Social).

KPIs: Sessions, Leads, Cost, Revenue, CAC = Cost/Leads, ROAS = Revenue/Cost (guard against ÷0).

Charts: Line (Revenue over time), Bar (Top channels by Leads), Pie (Spend split). Tooltips & legends included.

Run now: Simulated job streams logs (connect→query→aggregate→render). Shows rows processed and a link to a static “export” CSV.

Scheduler preview: Presets (Daily 08:00, Hourly, Weekly Mon 09:00) or cron input. Compute and display next 5 run times (approximate).

Run History: Table with status pills, duration, rows, log modal.

CTA: “Email us to connect GA/ads/CRM & schedule real runs.”

Acceptance criteria

Seed ~6 months of daily data across ≥3 channels; filters recompute KPIs live.

“Run now” always logs 4–6 steps and respects Inject Failure.

Cron parser rejects invalid strings with a friendly error and examples.

Export downloads a filtered CSV (static file is acceptable if filename reflects filters).

Nice‑to‑add

Anomaly chip (“ROAS spike”) that toggles an explainer.

Save View (stores filters locally; prompts for email to persist).

3) Quoting Tool (Inventory Match + Margins + Follow‑ups)

Goal: Generate a professional quote with live‑feeling inventory checks, margin math, and automated follow‑ups—still simulated.

Required features

Step 1 – Customer: Name, email, company. Default expires in 14 days; editable.

Step 2 – Items: Typeahead SKU search shows stock; alternative SKUs when low stock; quantity picker.

Pricing rule: Auto‑price = cost × (1 + margin tier) (tiers by subtotal or quantity).

Show per‑line and overall margin %; colour cues for below‑target.

Step 3 – Review & Send: Totals (subtotal, VAT 20%, shipping), delivery ETA from stock, margin summary, notes.

Buttons: Generate PDF (templated/static with brand + “DEMO” watermark), Send quote (toast + status=sent), Accept (status=accepted).

Follow‑ups: Prebuilt cadence (T+2, T+7) with statuses (due/sent/answered).

Inventory simulation: Deducts from stock on “Accept”; if insufficient, surface alt SKUs automatically.

CTA: “Email us to connect ERP/CRM, live stock & e‑sign.”

Acceptance criteria

Price and margin recompute instantly on quantity/discount edits.

VAT on/off toggle (defaults ON at 20%); totals update correctly.

PDF downloads within 2s and includes line items, totals, expiry, and contact.

Follow‑up schedule renders dates in Europe/London; can be marked done.

Nice‑to‑add

Discount line (absolute or %) with margin impact preview.

“Clone quote” to create variants.

Non‑functional & QA Checklist (all pages)

Performance: First interactive < 2s on mid‑range laptop; animations ≤ 200ms.

A11y: Visible focus, ARIA for live regions (logs), escape to close dialogs.

Errors: Friendly, actionable messages; never expose stack traces.

Telemetry review: Confirm events fire for all CTAs and runs; export sample event log.

Reset demo: Returns app to a known baseline without reload.

Copy pass: UK spelling, concise labels, consistent date/time and £ formatting.

Handover deliverables

Seed data files, simulation config (with RNG seed), demo scripts (3–5 minute paths), PDF template, and a short runbook (“how to reset, how to time‑lapse, how to inject failure”).

For our apps, I've been using IBM Carbon design. I didn't like how  "generic react frontend" everything was turning out with the rounded edges etc. Is this clash going to be a problem? To be clear, this is for the subdomains, hosting our SAAS products.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 42s

Short answer: you’re fine. Using IBM Carbon for your SaaS apps on subdomains won’t “clash” with your marketing site—as long as you lock a small brand contract (tokens + a few UI rules). Carbon actually helps you avoid the “generic rounded React” look because it’s flatter, squarer, and more systematic by default.

Here’s how to make them feel cohesive without fighting Carbon:

What to standardise across subdomains

Theme: Use Carbon g90/g100 (dark) or g10 (light) as the base. Your site vibe sounds closer to g100 (very dark).

Accent: Map your electric blue to Carbon’s interactive and link tokens (primary button, focus ring, data highlights). Keep it off large backgrounds.

Corners: Carbon is already minimal; set global radius = 0–2px to avoid the soft, app-store feel.

Density: Switch to compact density for a “tool, not brochure” vibe.

Motion: Keep micro-transitions under 150–200ms; no big easing theatrics.

Typography: Keep Carbon’s type scale but set families to match your brand (e.g., Inter/Space Grotesk) via the token hook.

Iconography: Prefer Carbon Icons; only introduce brand glyphs (logo, product marks).

Minimal “brand contract” (one-time)

Pick base theme (e.g., g100).

Override tokens for accent + focus + links (primary only).

Set radius + shadows: radius ≤2px; shadows subtle or none.

Content tone: UK spelling; concise microcopy.

Shell: Same top-left logo and product name across apps; a compact app-switcher to other subdomains; consistent account menu.

Example overrides (Carbon v11+ idea; adjust names to your version)
:root {
  /* Colors */
  --cds-interactive-01: #12A7FF;  /* primary button */
  --cds-link-01: #12A7FF;         /* links */
  --cds-focus: #12A7FF;           /* focus ring */
  /* Optional neutrals tweak */
  /* --cds-background: #0B0B10; --cds-layer-01: #14161A; --cds-text-primary: #E6E8EB; */

  /* Corners (if available in your build), else override per-component */
  --cds-border-radius: 2px;
}
/* Belt-and-braces for corners if tokens aren’t available everywhere */
.cds--btn, .cds--tile, .cds--tag, .cds--text-input, .cds--dropdown, .cds--modal {
  border-radius: 2px;
}

Will it feel “off” next to the website?

Not if you keep these bridges:

Color bridge: same accent blue; same neutral contrast.

Type bridge: same families and weights for headings/body.

Content bridge: same tone and terminology (“Discovery Sprint”, “Pilot Build”, etc.).

Nav bridge: show the Kyros logo and a subtle “Back to kyros.solutions” in the app header or help menu.

Where clashes usually happen (and how to avoid)

Too many accents → limit blue to interactive elements; keep surfaces neutral.

Shadowy cards → Carbon prefers layered neutrals; keep shadows ultra-subtle or none.

Spacing drift → stick to Carbon’s spacing scale for rhythm.

Chart styling → map chart palette to your neutrals + accent (no rainbow).

Practical rollout plan

Create a Kyros Carbon theme package (tokens + CSS layer) and apply it to all subdomains.

Build a tiny App Shell repo (header, nav, page grid) and consume it in each product.

Add a visual regression baseline (per-page snapshots) to keep radius/spacing from drifting.

Ship a UI checklist (radius, focus, density, motion, contrast) and gate PRs on it.

Bottom line: Carbon is a strong fit for serious, tool-like apps. With a few token overrides and a shared shell, your SaaS subdomains will look intentionally “Kyros”—not generic—while staying consistent and fast to build.

How do I fit this in to my project structure? Currently I have several different repos etc and they are all separate
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 38s

Totally workable—keep your apps separate, but centralise the brand + UX “contract” so Carbon feels Kyros everywhere. Here’s a practical way to fit this into what you already have.

The goal

One source of truth for: theme tokens, layout shell, analytics, and QA. Each app (subdomain) depends on those shared packages.

Option A (recommended for now): Stay polyrepo, share via private npm packages

Create three small shared repos and publish them to a private registry (GitHub Packages or npm org):

1) @kyros/design — Carbon theme + tokens

Exposes CSS variables + SCSS maps + a tiny “ThemeProvider” for runtime toggles (g10/g100).

Contents:

/src
  /scss/_kyros-carbon.scss   # imports Carbon, sets $theme, exports CSS vars
  /css/kyros.css             # built CSS with tokens
  /theme/ThemeProvider.tsx   # optional, sets data-theme & density
  /tokens/index.ts           # hex, spacing, radii, z-index


Example SCSS entry:

@use '@carbon/styles/scss/themes';
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/theme' with ($theme: themes.$g100);
@use '@carbon/styles';

:root {
  --cds-interactive-01: #12A7FF; /* Kyros primary */
  --cds-link-01: #12A7FF;
  --cds-focus: #12A7FF;
  /* Optional neutrals to match site */
  /* --cds-background: #0B0B10; --cds-layer-01: #14161A; --cds-text-primary: #E6E8EB; */
}
/* Tight corners everywhere */
.cds--btn, .cds--tile, .cds--tag, .cds--text-input, .cds--dropdown, .cds--modal { border-radius: 2px; }


2) @kyros/shell — shared app chrome (header, app-switcher, account, footer)

React + Carbon only; no app logic.

Props: appName, activeNav, links, onSearch, supportLink="https://kyros.solutions".

3) @kyros/telemetry — tiny analytics abstraction

API: track(event, payload); adapters for GA4/Segment later; no-ops in dev/demo.

Each product app adds:

npm i @kyros/design @kyros/shell @kyros/telemetry


and at the app entry:

import '@kyros/design/css/kyros.css';
import { AppShell } from '@kyros/shell';
import { track } from '@kyros/telemetry';


Versioning & updates

Use Changesets in each shared repo.

Enable Renovate (or Dependabot) in product repos to auto-PR version bumps of @kyros/*.

Visual QA

Central Storybook in @kyros/shell (and token stories in @kyros/design).

Add Chromatic or Playwright screenshot tests to prevent radius/spacing regressions.

CI/CD

On main of shared repos: build + publish (scoped, read-token only).

On product repos: install, build, smoke E2E, deploy.

Option B: Create an aggregator monorepo (gradual)

Add a new repo (keep apps where they are), then mirror them in as Git submodules or “remote workspaces”:

/kyros-frontend
  /apps
    reporting/            # points to existing repo
    translation-lab/      # "
    quoting-tool/         # "
  /packages
    design/               # @kyros/design
    shell/                # @kyros/shell
    telemetry/            # @kyros/telemetry
  package.json (pnpm or npm workspaces)
  turbo.json (or nx.json)


This gives you one CI to run cross-app checks + visual tests, while you keep deployment per-app.

Migration plan (no big-bang)

Extract tokens first → publish @kyros/design; wire into one app; verify no visual drift.

Adopt shell → swap each app’s header for <AppShell>; keep routes/content unchanged.

Add telemetry → replace ad-hoc analytics with track().

Introduce Storybook for shell + key screens of each app (health check).

Automate Renovate + CI gates (lint, unit, visual snapshot, build).

Folder hints per product app
/src
  /app-shell/   # thin wrappers or app-specific nav config
  /pages/...
  /features/... # reporting, translation, quoting
  /shared/...
  index.tsx


Keep domain logic in features, not in shell.

Co-locate SCSS or use CSS-in-JS only for dynamic states; prefer Carbon classes.

Guardrails to avoid “generic React”

Radius ≤ 2px, compact density, minimal shadows.

One accent (your blue) for interactive states only.

Carbon Icons; single type scale (no rogue font sizes).

Chart theme mapped to tokens (no rainbow palettes).

Quick checklist

 @kyros/design loads first in every app.

 All apps render inside @kyros/shell.

 A11y pass: focus rings visible, keyboard nav works.

 Visual regression on shell + 3 hero screens per app.

 Renovate PRs auto-bump @kyros/*; CI blocks on failing visual diffs.

If you want, I can draft the initial @kyros/design and @kyros/shell file trees plus a starter CI workflow you can drop into GitHub Actions.

p "$SESSION:watch.0" "fish -lc 'mkdir -p collaboration/events; touch collaboration/events/events.jsonl; tail -F collaboration/events/events.jsonl'"
tmux split-window -h -t "$SESSION:watch"
p "$SESSION:watch.1" "fish -lc 'watch -n 3 \"jq -r \\\".[]|[.id,.status]|@tsv\\\" collaboration/state/tasks.json 2>/dev/null; or cat collaboration/state/tasks.json\"'"

tmux select-pane -t "$SESSION:control.1"
tmux attach -t "$SESSION"


Run: scripts/kyros_agents.tmux.sh (or pass a custom session name).

Env & notes

Set these in ~/.config/fish/config.fish (or your secrets manager):

set -gx OPENAI_API_KEY <openai>
set -gx ZAI_CODING_PLAN_KEY <glm>
set -gx QWEN_API_KEY <qwen>; set -gx QWEN_API_BASE https://your-qwen-openai-compatible-base/v1
set -gx OC_API_KEY <opencode>; set -gx OC_API_BASE https://your-opencode-openai-compatible-base/v1


The panes intentionally inherit fish and call your CLIs in the right model context.

Layout & dispatcher mirror your previous script so it’s familiar.

If you want, I can add a “rotate model” key-binding and a minimal session doctor that validates keys before opening panes.

Is there a way to send commands from one window to another?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 2m 29s

Yep—tmux makes this easy. You’ve got a few good patterns, from one-off CLI sends to smooth keybindings and even “broadcast” mode.

1) One-off from your shell (anywhere)

Target a pane with session:window.pane:

tmux send-keys -t kyros-agents:impl.0 'make build' C-m
tmux send-keys -t kyros-agents:control.1 'codex --help' C-m


Tip: you already use a helper like this in your script:

p(){ tmux send-keys -t "$1" "$2" C-m; }
# usage:
p kyros-agents:impl.0 'echo hello'


So keep calling p target 'cmd'. 

two_deck

2) Fish helper (type less)

Add to ~/.config/fish/functions/tsend.fish:

function tsend
    set -l target $argv[1]
    set -l cmd (string join ' ' $argv[2..-1])
    tmux send-keys -t $target -- $cmd C-m
end
# usage: tsend kyros-agents:control.1 'codex plan --file foo.ts'

3) Handy tmux keybindings (prompt for target & cmd)

Drop in ~/.tmux.conf:

Prompt both target and command (quick + flexible):

bind s command-prompt -p "target (sess:win.pane),command" "send-keys -t %1 %2 C-m"


Pick a target via a tree UI, then type command (minimal typing):

bind S choose-tree -Zw "command-prompt -p 'command' 'send-keys -t %% %1 C-m'"


Usage: Prefix+S → pick the pane → enter the command → it runs there.

4) Broadcast to all panes in one window

Great when you want to run the same thing everywhere (e.g., start watchers):

setw -w synchronize-panes on   # per-window toggle
# bind a toggle:
bind y setw synchronize-panes\; display-message "sync: #{?synchronize-panes,on,off}"


(Type once; every pane in that window receives the keystrokes.)

5) Paste buffers into another pane (copy → send)

For “send this text I just copied”:

# copy some text (copy-mode) → it’s in the tmux buffer
tmux paste-buffer -t kyros-agents:impl.0


Or capture recent lines from one pane and paste to another:

tmux capture-pane -pt srcsess:win.pane -S -10 -E - \|
  tmux load-buffer - \; paste-buffer -t destsess:win.pane

Notes

send-keys is literal keystrokes—whatever program is in the target pane will receive them (shell, REPL, codex, etc.).

If a command contains quotes/spaces, wrap it as shown or use -- before the command to be safe.

If you often send to the same panes, rename windows (control, impl, etc.) and bind fixed shortcuts:

bind i send-keys -t '{session_name}:impl.0' 'tail -F logs/impl/*.log' C-m
bind c send-keys -t '{session_name}:control.1' 'codex plan --reset' C-m


With these, you can fire off builds/tests from your “watch” or “control” window and have them execute in “impl”, “codex”, or wherever—no tab juggling required.

Opencode actually does its own orchestration, and comes with a basic sdk. Please could you give me a prompt that I could give to my architect and planner, that would let them advise me on configuring opencode to work with  the rest of our stack? It should have explicit instructions about the custom headers we have
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 1m 0s

Here’s a single, hand-off prompt for your architect & planner to design how OpenCode (grok-code-fast, with its own orchestration + SDK) plugs into the Kyros stack. It’s platform-agnostic, assumes subdomain SaaS apps, IBM Carbon UI, and fish-driven ops. It includes explicit custom header rules, security, observability, and acceptance criteria.

Kyros ↔ OpenCode Integration — Architecture & Planning Prompt
Context & goal

We will onboard OpenCode as an internal “code/automation orchestrator” used by our products (Reporting Studio, Translation Lab, Quoting Tool). OpenCode ships with its own orchestration and a basic SDK. Deliver a design and plan so it:

runs as a first-class service in our stack,

respects multi-tenant + auditing,

interops with existing agent CLIs (codex-cli gpt-5, Claude glm-4.5, Qwen, etc.),

can be toggled Simulated vs Live for demos,

uses our custom headers end-to-end.

Non-negotiables

All inbound and outbound API calls touching OpenCode (SDK, REST, webhooks) MUST send and/or propagate the headers below.

Zero PII leakage in logs; redact sensitive values.

Idempotent execution for create/run operations (idempotency key).

Observability: traces/metrics/logs with correlation IDs.

Required custom headers (define exactly as below)

These are required on: (a) calls from our apps → OpenCode, (b) OpenCode → our services, (c) any webhook callbacks, and (d) inter-service hops triggered by OpenCode.

Header	Purpose	Example	Rules
X-Kyros-Tenant	Tenant scoping	acme-uk	Required on all calls; validated against auth claims
X-Kyros-Actor	End-user or service principal	user:ken.mahon / svc:reporting	For audit trail; default from JWT sub
X-Kyros-Run-Id	Correlation ID for a single run	run_2025-09-17T09:42Z_7f3a	Generated once at entrypoint, propagated unchanged
X-Kyros-Trace	Trace/span correlation	trace-uuid	Map to OTEL trace id; pass-through
X-Kyros-Mode	Execution mode	live | simulate	Feature-flag behaviours; simulate by default in demos
X-Kyros-Consent	Data/PII handling	no-pii | pii-ok:crm	Gate model/tool usage; enforce redaction
X-Kyros-Client-Version	App/build version	quoting@1.8.3	For debugging rollouts
X-Kyros-Feature	Feature flag tag	reporting.scheduler.v2	Optional; helps A/B
X-Idempotency-Key	Safe retries	uuid-v4	Required on POST/PUT of runs
X-Kyros-Signature	HMAC over body	sha256=...	Secret per tenant; verify at gateway
Header placement

Edge (API gateway) injects/validates: Run-Id, Trace, Signature.

Service code sets: Tenant, Actor, Mode, Client-Version, Feature, Consent, Idempotency.

Auth & routing

Prefer JWT Bearer between apps and our API; gateway verifies and forwards only required claims to OpenCode via headers.

OpenCode SDK calls outbound to our APIs must include the same header set; provide a tiny wrapper (kyros-http) that auto-adds them.

Data & orchestration model

Treat OpenCode as primary coordinator for code execution chains.

Our products submit plans/tasks with metadata (tenant, actor, mode).

OpenCode invokes tools or our microservices via REST/SDK through the gateway with headers.

Webhooks (status, step events) call back to our “Run History” endpoint using the same header contract.

Error, retry, idempotency

All run-creating endpoints: return 409 on duplicate X-Idempotency-Key.

Retries: exponential backoff with jitter; cap 3.

Error payloads: include run_id, trace, sanitized cause.

Observability

Adopt OpenTelemetry context propagation; map X-Kyros-Trace to W3C traceparent if supported.

Metrics: runs_started, runs_succeeded, runs_failed, avg_step_latency, tokens_used (if available).

Logs: structured JSON; redact secrets; include tenant/actor/run_id.

Security

HMAC verify X-Kyros-Signature at gateway; reject if missing/invalid.

Per-tenant allowlist for tools/models; enforce via X-Kyros-Consent.

Secrets live in vault; SDK receives only short-lived tokens.

Reference snippets (use/adapt)

Typescript wrapper (SDK or REST fallback):

export function kyrosHeaders(ctx){ return {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${ctx.jwt}`,
  'X-Kyros-Tenant': ctx.tenant,
  'X-Kyros-Actor': ctx.actor,
  'X-Kyros-Run-Id': ctx.runId,
  'X-Kyros-Trace': ctx.traceId,
  'X-Kyros-Mode': ctx.mode ?? 'simulate',
  'X-Kyros-Consent': ctx.consent ?? 'no-pii',
  'X-Kyros-Client-Version': ctx.clientVersion,
  'X-Kyros-Feature': ctx.feature ?? '',
  'X-Idempotency-Key': ctx.idemKey,
  'X-Kyros-Signature': hmac(ctx.secret, ctx.body)
};}


fish env hints (dev):

set -gx KYROS_TENANT acme-uk
set -gx KYROS_MODE simulate
set -gx KYROS_CLIENT_VERSION quoting@dev

Deliverables (from architect & planner)

Sequence diagram showing headers across: App → Gateway → OpenCode → Our APIs → Webhooks.

Gateway policy: exact header inject/verify/redact rules + HMAC config.

kyros-http wrapper (Node/Python) that enforces headers for SDK & REST.

Config matrix per product: which tools/models OpenCode may call in simulate vs live.

Run History spec (fields & retention), mapping from OpenCode step events.

Failure playbook (timeouts, partial failures, retries, alerting).

Acceptance criteria

Test run from each product shows complete correlated trail (run_id/trace) in logs/metrics.

Webhook callbacks received with signature verified; idempotent on retries.

Toggle simulate→live without code change (config only).

No PII or secrets in logs; redaction unit tests pass.

Use this as the working brief; where OpenCode SDK offers a richer hook, document the mapping—but the header contract above must remain identical across SDK and REST paths.

How about this plan? In a very thorough cost/performance analysis Alibaba came out as the clear winner, soperhaps it makes sense to start now...>? 
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 29s

Short answer: yes—start, but do it as a guard-railed pilot. Your plan (OpenCode + env/header wrapper + Alibaba managed Redis/Postgres/FC + API Gateway) is sound and fast to ship; just pass a few go/no-go checks below, then run a 2-week pilot on one product (Reporting Studio) before broad rollout. 

opencode-integration-architectu…

Why Alibaba now

Your cost/perf analysis says it wins, and the reference design uses managed Redis, RDS-PostgreSQL, Function Compute, and API Gateway—so low ops + quick ROI. 

opencode-integration-architectu…

The wrapper + header injection approach keeps agents unchanged and enforces your Kyros header contract end-to-end. 

opencode-integration-architectu…

Pre-flight (green-light these)

Data residency & client posture: confirm region(s) meet UK/EU requirements and any enterprise customer constraints.

SLA/support tier: pick support plan and uptime SLAs for gateway/DB/FC.

Security: KMS/Secrets Manager, per-tenant HMAC for X-Kyros-Signature, least-privilege RAM roles, private VPC endpoints.

Networking: VPC/VSwitch, NAT, WAF if apps are public; API Gateway auth (JWT) + header validation at edge.

Cost guardrails: tag-based budgets/alerts; autoscale limits for FC; storage & egress caps.

Latency SLOs: measure P50/P95 from your user regions to chosen Alibaba region; set “fail open to simulate” if > target.

Observability: Cloud-native logs + metrics + OTEL traces; run_id/trace headers propagated everywhere.

Idempotency: enforce X-Idempotency-Key on create/run endpoints; 409 on dupes.

Change safety: feature flag X-Kyros-Mode: simulate|live, default simulate for demos; kill-switch per tenant.

Runbook/rollback: documented restore for Redis/RDS; infra as code committed.

Pilot plan (14 days)

Day 0–2: Stand up base stack (ROS/Terraform), VPC, API Gateway, FC service; wire header validation + injection at gateway. Seed RDS schema and Redis keys. 

opencode-integration-architectu…


Day 3–5: Drop in the agent wrapper (env → headers) and update your tmux launcher to call it; start OpenCode orchestrator pointing at Redis/RDS. 

opencode-integration-architectu…


Day 6–8: Integrate Reporting Studio only. Route “Run now” via OpenCode; store plan in Redis; write step/status to RDS.
Day 9–11: Bake simulate/live toggles; add webhook callbacks to your Run History endpoint with HMAC verification. 

opencode-integration-architectu…


Day 12–14: Load test, chaos (agent timeout), failure drills; cost & latency report; stakeholder demo.

Risks & mitigations

Vendor lock-in → keep a neutral kyros-http shim for SDK/REST and standardize on your header contract; infra as code enables re-targeting.

Latency spikes → FC concurrency limits + warmers; cache plan fragments in Redis; backpressure to agents.

Cost drift → budgets/alerts per tag; scale-to-zero FC for idle periods; storage lifecycle policies.

Security drift → OPA/WAF policies at gateway; signature verification mandatory; redaction in logs.

Acceptance criteria for “go live”

End-to-end run shows correlated trace (run_id/trace) across gateway→OpenCode→agents→webhooks; webhook signature passes.

P95 latencies within agreed SLO; failure toggles work; simulate→live is config-only.

Budget alarms wired; daily cost under pilot cap; RPO/RTO documented and tested.

If all green, expand to Translation Lab and Quoting Tool. If anything is amber, keep simulator mode as default and iterate—your architecture already supports that path.

You said:
I'm not going to make it public right now,give me a plan just to get it running so I can develop with it
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 36s

Perfect—here’s a tight local-only dev plan to get OpenCode running with your agents, headers, and logs—no public exposure, just your laptop (or a private dev box). I’ve included copy-paste files and commands.

0) Prereqs

macOS/Linux, Docker (or Podman), Python 3.11+, tmux, fish, jq.

CLIs you already use: codex-cli (gpt-5), qwen, glm-4.5, opencode/grok.

Create a work dir: mkdir -p ~/kyros/opencode-dev && cd ~/kyros/opencode-dev

1) Local services (Redis + Postgres)

docker-compose.yml

version: "3.9"
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    command: ["redis-server","--appendonly","no"]
    ports: ["127.0.0.1:6379:6379"]
  pg:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: devpass
      POSTGRES_USER: kyros
      POSTGRES_DB: opencode
    ports: ["127.0.0.1:5432:5432"]


Start: docker compose up -d

2) Dev env & headers (fish)

~/.config/fish/conf.d/kyros_dev.fish

set -gx REDIS_URL redis://127.0.0.1:6379
set -gx POSTGRES_URL postgres://kyros:devpass@127.0.0.1:5432/opencode
set -gx KYROS_TENANT acme-uk
set -gx KYROS_MODE simulate
set -gx KYROS_CONSENT no-pii
function kyros_run_env
  set -gx KYROS_RUN_ID run_(date -u +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")_(uuidgen | cut -c1-8)
  set -gx KYROS_TRACE_ID (uuidgen)
end

3) Universal agent wrapper (adds custom headers)

Create scripts/agent-wrapper.sh:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
AGENT_CMD="$1"; shift
export AGENT_HEADERS=$(cat <<EOF
{"X-Kyros-Tenant":"${KYROS_TENANT}",
 "X-Kyros-Actor":"agent:${AGENT_TYPE:-unknown}",
 "X-Kyros-Run-Id":"${KYROS_RUN_ID}",
 "X-Kyros-Mode":"${KYROS_MODE:-simulate}",
 "X-Kyros-Consent":"${KYROS_CONSENT:-no-pii}",
 "X-Kyros-Trace":"${KYROS_TRACE_ID}"}
EOF
)
# OpenAI-compatible CLIs can read default headers from env
export OPENAI_DEFAULT_HEADERS="$AGENT_HEADERS"
echo (date -u +"%FT%TZ")" | ${AGENT_TYPE:-unknown} | $KYROS_RUN_ID | start" >> logs/agent-audit.log
exec $AGENT_CMD "$@"


This mirrors your header contract and the wrapper approach in your integration doc. 

opencode-integration-architectu…

4) Minimal orchestrator (local FastAPI)

opencode/orchestrator.py (trimmed to essentials):

import os, json, asyncio, redis, psycopg2
from fastapi import FastAPI, Header
app = FastAPI()
r = redis.from_url(os.getenv("REDIS_URL"))
db = psycopg2.connect(os.getenv("POSTGRES_URL"))

def tmux_send(window, cmd): os.system(f"tmux send-keys -t {window} '{cmd}' C-m")

@app.post("/orchestrate")
async def orchestrate(plan: dict,
  x_kyros_tenant: str = Header(), x_kyros_run_id: str = Header(),
  x_kyros_mode: str = Header(default="simulate")):
    r.setex(f"plan:{x_kyros_run_id}", 3600, json.dumps(plan))
    # Dispatch a single demo task to grok (OpenCode) via tmux
    tmux_send(f"{os.getenv('TMUX_SESSION', 'kyros-agents')}:opencode.0",
              f"AGENT_TYPE=grok KYROS_RUN_ID={x_kyros_run_id} ./scripts/agent-wrapper.sh opencode --take task:{plan.get('id','demo')}")
    # Poll for a result written by the agent (simulate for dev)
    for _ in range(30):
        res = r.get(f"result:{x_kyros_run_id}:{plan.get('id','demo')}")
        if res: return json.loads(res)
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return {"run_id": x_kyros_run_id, "status":"timeout"}


The pattern (store plan in Redis → tmux send → poll for result) matches the snippets in your architecture notes. 

opencode-integration-architectu…

Run locally:

python -m pip install fastapi uvicorn redis psycopg2-binary
KYROS_MODE=simulate TMUX_SESSION=kyros-agents uvicorn opencode.orchestrator:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8088

5) Dev tmux session (agents + logs)

scripts/kyros_agents.tmux.sh

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail; SESSION="${1:-kyros-agents}"
tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -n control
tmux new-window  -t "$SESSION" -n opencode
tmux send-keys   -t "$SESSION:opencode.0" "fish -lc 'kyros_run_env; AGENT_TYPE=grok ./scripts/agent-wrapper.sh opencode'" C-m
tmux new-window  -t "$SESSION" -n impl
tmux send-keys   -t "$SESSION:impl.0" "fish -lc 'mkdir -p logs/impl; tail -F logs/impl/*.log || tail -f /dev/null'" C-m
tmux new-window  -t "$SESSION" -n watch
tmux send-keys   -t "$SESSION:watch.0" "fish -lc 'mkdir -p collaboration/events; touch collaboration/events/events.jsonl; tail -F collaboration/events/events.jsonl'" C-m
tmux attach -t "$SESSION"


This follows your existing tmux pattern so it’s familiar. 

two_deck

6) Quick “hello plan” test (no public exposure)

Terminal A (start services): docker compose up -d
Terminal B (tmux agents): scripts/kyros_agents.tmux.sh
Terminal C (orchestrator): (command above)
Terminal D (call API with headers):

kyros_run_env  # sets RUN_ID/TRACE
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8088/orchestrate \
 -H "X-Kyros-Tenant: $KYROS_TENANT" \
 -H "X-Kyros-Run-Id: $KYROS_RUN_ID" \
 -H "X-Kyros-Mode: $KYROS_MODE" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"id":"demo","execution_groups":[{"tasks":[{"id":"t1","type":"implementation"}]}]}'


Your doc’s dispatch/poll pattern is what the endpoint implements, and it honors the same headers. 

opencode-integration-architectu…

7) Webhook loop (optional, still local)

Add a tiny sender that posts status with your headers and HMAC when you’re ready; your reference shows exactly how to build/sign those headers. 

opencode-integration-architectu…

8) Dev toggles

Sim vs Live: set -gx KYROS_MODE simulate (default) / live, with feature gates as in your modes.yaml. 

opencode-integration-architectu…

Per-run IDs: kyros_run_env before each run to regenerate IDs.

9) Done criteria (for “I can develop”)

You can orchestrate a plan locally and see: (a) plan cached in Redis, (b) an agent pane receive the tmux command, (c) a result JSON stored/read under result:<run>:<task>. 

opencode-integration-architectu…

Headers (X-Kyros-Tenant/Run-Id/Mode/Consent/Trace) are present on your curl and in the wrapper’s env. 

opencode-integration-architectu…

Notes

Everything binds to 127.0.0.1; nothing public.

When you’re ready to collaborate with a remote teammate, use Tailscale/SSH tunnel—not a public URL.

You can swap the agent in the opencode pane to Qwen/Codex/GLM by setting AGENT_TYPE and launching the appropriate CLI through the wrapper—your router can then iterate later. 

opencode-integration-architectu…

If you want, I can generate the files into a zip with the exact structure for you to drop into ~/kyros/opencode-dev.
