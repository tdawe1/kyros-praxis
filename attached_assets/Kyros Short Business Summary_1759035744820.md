Professional Business Summary Example:

"Our business is a UK-based IT consultancy. We specialize in providing developing custom software solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, that mainly centre on AI-based automation. We will also be offering some of our less bespoke tools via subscription on our SaaS portal. Our focus is on delivering measurable results that integrate seemleslly with the customer's requirements, with everything based on provable ROI and time saved. Our primary offering is a 4-8 week set of sprints based off the Agile or Scrum frameworks - we do a discovery phase where we get to understand the client's pain points, bottlenecks and workflow, we then implement an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and move to the iteration phase. The goal is to have a long term relationship with the client after the original implementation.  We work with international partners and handle multi-currency transactions, primarily in USD and GBP, and occassionally JPY to facilitate our global client base."
