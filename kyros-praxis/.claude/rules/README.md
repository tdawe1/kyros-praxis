# Kyros Praxis — AI Rules & Plans

This folder consolidates active AI‑related docs for the project. Keep these up to date after the planning stage — when scope or milestones change, update the relevant doc in the same PR.

## Quick Links
- Backend plan: `./backend-current-plan.md`
- Frontend plan: `./frontend-current-plan.md`
- Task index: `./tasks_deduped.md`

## Guidelines
- Prefer minimal diffs and keep plans in sync with shipped work.
- When updating backend or frontend scope, edit the matching plan file and reference it in your PR description.
