## Conclusion

The hybrid model strategy offers significant cost savings (35-45%) while maintaining or improving quality across all roles. The implementation requires a 6-week investment of $18,975 with a break-even period of approximately 3 years and a 5-year ROI of 76%.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with implementation, starting with Phase 1 GLM-4.5 universal deployment, followed by Phase 2 escalation logic development, and concluding with Phase 3 validation and optimization.

The risk-adjusted analysis shows that even under pessimistic scenarios, the strategy provides substantial cost benefits while maintaining operational quality. The qualitative benefits of simplified architecture and consistent performance further justify the investment.
