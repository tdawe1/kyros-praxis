# 0002: Hybrid Model Strategy Implementation Plan

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-09-13  
**Author:** kyrosArchitect  
**Impact:** High (cost optimization, model consolidation)

## Context

Current Kyros system utilizes multiple AI models across different roles, resulting in:
- Complex routing logic and configuration overhead
- Inconsistent model performance across tasks
- Higher operational costs due to premium model usage
- Maintenance complexity for multiple provider integrations

**Current Model Landscape:**
- **Architect:** `openrouter/sonoma-sky-alpha` → `glm-4.5` fallback
- **Orchestrator:** `openrouter/sonoma-sky-alpha` 
- **Implementer:** `glm-4.5` → `openrouter/sonoma-sky-alpha` fallback
- **Critic:** `openrouter/sonoma-sky-alpha` → `meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free` fallback
- **Integrator:** `gpt-5` (varies by complexity)
- **Additional models:** GPT-5, Claude variants, Gemini Pro/Flash, etc.

## Decision

Implement a hybrid model strategy with:
- **Primary Universal Model:** GLM-4.5 (95% of all tasks)
- **Critical Decision Model:** Claude 4.1 Opus (5% for critical architectural decisions)
- **Simplified fallback chain:** GLM-4.5 → OpenRouter Sonoma Sky Alpha → Free tier models

This approach optimizes costs while maintaining quality for critical architectural decisions that require superior reasoning capabilities.

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes
- **Cost Reduction:** 30-50% decrease in model usage costs
- **Simplified Architecture:** Reduced routing complexity and configuration overhead
- **Consistent Performance:** Standardized model behavior across roles
- **Operational Efficiency:** Easier monitoring, debugging, and maintenance

### Implementation Challenges
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensuring GLM-4.5 meets all role requirements
- **Escalation Logic:** Defining precise triggers for Claude 4.1 Opus usage
- **Performance Monitoring:** Tracking model-specific metrics and performance
- **Rollback Procedures:** Ensuring quick reversion if issues arise

### Technical Changes Required
- Configuration file updates across multiple services
- New escalation detection logic
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting
- Updated role-specific instructions
- Testing framework adjustments

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: GLM-4.5 Universal Deployment (Weeks 1-2)
- Update all role configurations to use GLM-4.5 as primary
- Implement basic escalation detection
- Deploy with canary testing approach
- Monitor performance across all roles

### Phase 2: Claude 4.1 Opus Trigger Definition (Week 3)
- Define specific criteria for critical architectural decisions
- Implement escalation logic and procedures
- Create documentation and guidelines
- Train team on escalation procedures

### Phase 3: Validation and Optimization (Weeks 4-6)
- Comprehensive testing across all use cases
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Cost analysis and ROI validation
- Documentation completion and knowledge transfer

## Success Criteria

1. **Cost Reduction:** Achieve 30-50% reduction in model costs
2. **Quality Maintenance:** Maintain or improve task completion quality
3. **Performance Metrics:** Meet or exceed current response times
4. **User Satisfaction:** No negative impact on user experience
5. **Operational Stability:** System uptime and reliability maintained

## Rollback Plan

Immediate rollback capability through:
- Configuration versioning and quick revert
- Automated performance monitoring with alerts
- Defined failure thresholds for automatic rollback
- Communication protocol for system-wide rollback

## Monitoring Requirements

- Cost tracking by model and role
- Quality metrics and error rates
- Response time and performance indicators
- Escalation frequency and justification
- User feedback and satisfaction metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1:** Configuration updates and testing preparation
2. **Week 2:** GLM-4.5 deployment with monitoring
3. **Week 3:** Claude 4.1 Opus escalation implementation
4. **Weeks 4-6:** Validation, optimization, and documentation

## Stakeholders

- **Development Team:** Implementation and testing
- **Operations:** Deployment and monitoring
- **Product Management:** Requirements and success criteria
- **Finance:** Cost analysis and ROI validation
- **Users:** Feedback and acceptance testing
