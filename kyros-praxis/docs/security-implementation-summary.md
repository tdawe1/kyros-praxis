# Security Implementation Summary

## High Priority Security Enhancements (P1) - COMPLETED

### 1. ✅ Applied Security Middleware in Orchestrator Service
- **Location**: `services/orchestrator/main.py:60-72`
- **Changes**: Integrated comprehensive security middleware with proper configuration
- **Features Enabled**:
  - Rate limiting (100 requests/15 minutes)
  - CSRF protection for state-changing operations
  - Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
  - JWT authentication integration
  - HTTPS enforcement (disabled in local development)

### 2. ✅ Configured CORS with Proper Origins
- **Location**: `services/orchestrator/main.py:66`, `services/orchestrator/app/core/config.py:58-71`
- **Changes**:
  - CORS middleware now properly configured with origins from settings
  - Uses `settings.all_cors_origins` which includes both configured origins and frontend host
  - Restrictive CORS policy allowing only specific origins, methods, and headers

### 3. ✅ Added CSRF Token Generation and Validation
- **Location**: `services/orchestrator/security_middleware.py:77-113`, `main.py:72`
- **Implementation**:
  - CSRF tokens generated for GET requests and stored in secure cookies
  - Validation for POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH operations
  - Header-based validation (`X-CSRF-Token`)
  - Skip CSRF for API endpoints with valid JWT tokens
  - Secure cookies with HttpOnly and SameSite=strict

### 4. ✅ Enhanced WebSocket Authentication with JWT
- **Location**: `services/orchestrator/main.py:130-215`
- **Improvements**:
  - JWT authentication via query parameter or Authorization header
  - Proper token validation with issuer and audience checks
  - Enhanced error handling and connection closure
  - Message validation and structured responses
  - Connection metadata with user information and timestamps
  - Proper disconnect handling

### 5. ✅ Configured Security Headers
- **Location**: `services/orchestrator/security_middleware.py:172-182`, `244-277`
- **Headers Applied**:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` (in production)
  - `Content-Security-Policy` (environment-aware)
    - Production: Strict CSP with no unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval
    - Development: Permissive CSP for development tools

## Additional Security Features

### Rate Limiting
- Per-client rate limiting with configurable thresholds
- Different limits for authenticated users vs IP addresses
- Rate limit headers in responses
- Window-based reset tracking

### JWT Security
- HS512 algorithm (strong security)
- 2-hour token expiration
- Proper issuer and audience validation
- JWT ID for token revocation tracking

### Environment-Specific Configuration
- Security settings adapt based on environment (local/staging/production)
- HTTPS and secure cookies disabled in local development
- Production has stricter CSP and additional security headers

## Testing
- All 15 security tests passing
- Covers rate limiting, CSRF, JWT authentication, and database security
- Integration tests for complete security flow

## Files Modified
1. `services/orchestrator/main.py` - Integrated security middleware and enhanced WebSocket
2. `services/orchestrator/security_middleware.py` - Updated to use centralized configuration
3. `services/orchestrator/app/core/config.py` - Already had proper security configuration

The orchestrator service now has comprehensive security protection with proper authentication, authorization, and security headers configured according to best practices.
