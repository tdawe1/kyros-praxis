"""
Escalation Workflow Automation for the Kyros Orchestrator Hybrid AI Model System.

This module implements automated escalation workflows that handle the entire
escalation process from detection to execution and validation. It orchestrates
the intelligent switching between junior AI models (GLM-4.5) and senior AI
models (Claude 4.1 Opus) based on task complexity and risk assessment.

The workflow automation ensures cost-effective model selection while maintaining
quality for critical decisions through a multi-step process that includes
detection, analysis, decision-making, execution, and validation.

MODULE RESPONSIBILITIES:
------------------------
1. Workflow Orchestration:
   - Manages the complete lifecycle of escalation workflows
   - Coordinates between junior and senior AI models
   - Handles workflow state management and concurrency control

2. Escalation Automation:
   - Automatic escalation detection and triggering
   - Intelligent model selection based on task analysis
   - Cost-effective decision making for model usage

3. Process Management:
   - Multi-step escalation process (detection, analysis, decision, execution, validation)
   - Error handling and retry logic with fallback mechanisms
   - Performance monitoring and statistics tracking

4. Integration Hub:
   - Connects escalation triggers with context analysis
   - Coordinates with external AI model services
   - Provides audit logging for compliance and debugging

WORKFLOW COMPONENTS:
--------------------
1. Escalation Engine:
   - Main orchestrator that manages the entire escalation process
   - Handles workflow state management and concurrency control
   - Coordinates between different AI models based on task requirements

2. Workflow Manager:
   - Manages individual escalation workflows
   - Tracks workflow progress and status
   - Handles workflow persistence and recovery

3. Execution Handler:
   - Executes tasks with appropriate AI models
   - Manages model selection based on escalation decisions
   - Handles task execution and result collection

4. Validation System:
   - Validates escalation outcomes and task results
   - Performs quality assurance on AI-generated outputs
   - Ensures results meet required standards

5. Fallback Mechanism:
   - Handles fallback scenarios when escalation fails
   - Provides alternative approaches for task completion
   - Ensures system resilience and reliability

AUTOMATION FEATURES:
--------------------
- Automatic escalation detection and triggering through escalation_triggers.py
- Context analysis using context_analysis.py for intelligent decision making
- Workflow state management with comprehensive status tracking
- Integration with existing systems through standardized interfaces
- Error handling and retry logic with exponential backoff
- Performance monitoring with detailed statistics and metrics
- Audit logging for compliance, debugging, and optimization
- Concurrency control to manage multiple workflows simultaneously

ESCALATION DECISION PROCESS:
----------------------------
1. Detection Phase:
   - Analyze task description and files using escalation_triggers.py
   - Identify potential escalation triggers and risk factors
   - Generate initial escalation assessment

2. Analysis Phase:
   - Perform detailed context analysis using context_analysis.py
   - Evaluate code complexity, business impact, and risk assessment
   - Analyze dependencies and quality requirements

3. Decision Phase:
   - Combine trigger detection and context analysis results
   - Calculate overall confidence score for escalation
   - Make final decision on model selection (GLM-4.5 vs Claude 4.1 Opus)

4. Escalation Phase:
   - Execute escalation to senior AI model when required
   - Handle model switching and context transfer
   - Monitor escalation progress and performance

5. Execution Phase:
   - Execute task with selected AI model
   - Collect and process model outputs
   - Handle any execution errors or timeouts

6. Validation Phase:
   - Validate results against quality standards
   - Perform automated testing and verification
   - Generate final outcome assessment

INTEGRATION WITH OTHER MODULES:
-------------------------------
- escalation_triggers.py: Provides initial escalation trigger detection
- context_analysis.py: Delivers detailed context analysis for decision making
- main.py: Exposes escalation endpoints and integrates with orchestrator
- models.py: May use models for workflow persistence (future enhancement)

USAGE EXAMPLE:
--------------
# Submit an escalation request
workflow = await submit_escalation(
    task_description="Implement secure user authentication with JWT",
    files_to_modify=["auth.py", "models.py"],
    task_type="implementation",
    priority="high"
)

# Check workflow status
status = get_escalation_status(workflow.workflow_id)
if status.outcome == EscalationOutcome.SUCCESS:
    print("Escalation completed successfully")

# Get statistics
stats = get_escalation_stats()
print(f"Total escalations: {stats['escalated']}")
