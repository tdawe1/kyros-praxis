# Kyros Praxis — Project Plans

This repository tracks two living plans that guide implementation. Keep these up to date beyond the initial planning phase — when scope or milestones change, update the plan files in the same PR.

Maintenance
- Plans are source-of-truth for near-term work. Treat them like code: review, diff, and evolve alongside changes.
- PRs that materially affect scope/timelines must include updates to the plan(s).

Getting Started
- Backend dev: see the backend plan for the “steel thread” path to a local, testable API.
- Frontend dev: see the frontend plan for current gaps and next steps.
