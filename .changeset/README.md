This directory is reserved for Changesets. To create a release note:

1. Run the release workflow locally or via CI when implemented.
2. Add a markdown file here describing changes per package once packages are wired into a workspace.

Note: Workspace wiring is intentionally deferred to avoid clashing with existing setup.
