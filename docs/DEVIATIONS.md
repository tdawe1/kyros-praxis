# Deviations from Original Plan

- Frontend: Using Next.js 14.2.5 with App Router instead of React + Vite + TS. This provides built-in routing and server-side capabilities, aligning better with SSR needs for the console while maintaining client-side rendering for interactive components. No other major deviations at this time.
