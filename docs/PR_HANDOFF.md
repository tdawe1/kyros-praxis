## üîç Review Focus Areas

### Priority 1: Security
- Review tokenizer implementation for potential vulnerabilities
- Validate test database isolation in conftest.py
- Check for any exposed secrets or credentials

### Priority 2: Testing
- Verify test coverage improvements
- Review test fixture implementation
- Validate async test patterns

### Priority 3: Documentation
- Review audit findings for accuracy
- Validate roadmap feasibility
- Check Mermaid diagram rendering

## üéØ Next Sprint Priorities

Based on the audit findings, the following should be addressed immediately:

### Week 1 (Critical)
1. **Implement rate limiting** - P0 security issue
2. **Add security headers** - XSS protection
3. **Input validation audit** - SQL injection prevention

### Week 2 (High)
1. **Increase test coverage to 80%**
2. **Fix JWT refresh tokens**
3. **Add API documentation**

### Week 3 (Medium)
1. **Implement RBAC**
2. **Add error tracking (Sentry)**
3. **Implement audit logging**

## üìù Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- None

### Database Migrations
- None required

### Environment Variables
- New: `KYROS_TOKENIZER_FALLBACK` (optional, defaults to "true")

### Dependencies Added
- None (all test dependencies already present)

## üîß Testing Instructions

1. **Run Backend Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd kyros-praxis/services/orchestrator
   SECRET_KEY=test python -m pytest tests/unit/test_simple.py -v
   ```

2. **Run Frontend Lint**:
   ```bash
   cd kyros-praxis/services/console
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **Verify Tokenizer**:
   ```bash
   cd kyros-praxis/zen-mcp-server
   python -m pytest tests/test_gemini_tokenizer.py -v
   ```

## ü§ù Handoff Notes

### What Was Done Well
- Comprehensive test coverage improvements
- Thorough security audit with actionable findings
- Clear, prioritized roadmap for improvements
- Clean code with no lint errors

### Areas Needing Attention
- Rate limiting implementation (P0)
- RBAC implementation (P1)
- Test coverage still needs to reach 80%
- Monitoring and observability gaps

### Recommendations for Reviewers
1. Focus on security-related changes first
2. Validate test implementations work in CI/CD
3. Review roadmap priorities align with business goals
4. Consider scheduling follow-up for Week 1 priorities
