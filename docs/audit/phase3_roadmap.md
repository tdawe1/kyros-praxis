## Testing Strategy Enhancement

### Current State (60% coverage)
- Unit tests: Basic coverage
- Integration tests: Minimal
- E2E tests: None
- Performance tests: None

### Target State (90% coverage)
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # 80% coverage
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # Key workflows
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/           # Critical paths
â”œâ”€â”€ performance/   # Load testing
â””â”€â”€ security/      # Penetration tests
```

### Testing Priorities
1. **Week 1**: Add missing unit tests (orchestrator, console)
2. **Week 2**: Integration tests for auth flows
3. **Week 3**: E2E tests for critical user journeys
4. **Month 2**: Performance benchmarking
5. **Month 3**: Security penetration testing

## Documentation Blueprint

### Immediate Needs
