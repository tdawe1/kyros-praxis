## 1. 🏗️ Code Structure and Organization

### Strengths ✅
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Well-organized with clear separation between services, packages, and tools
- **Service-Oriented Design**: Clear microservices architecture (orchestrator, console, terminal-daemon)
- **Modular Package Structure**: Shared libraries properly organized in `/packages`
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Frontend (Next.js), Backend (FastAPI), Infrastructure (Docker)

### Weaknesses ❌
- **Duplicated Project Structure**: Nested `kyros-praxis/` directory creates confusion
- **Deprecated Code**: Multiple `_deprecated` directories indicate poor cleanup practices
- **Inconsistent Naming**: Mix of kebab-case and snake_case across services
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Several `main.py`, `server.py` files without clear hierarchy

### Severity Rating: **MEDIUM** 🟡

### Recommendations:
1. Flatten the nested directory structure
2. Remove deprecated code or move to separate archive
3. Establish consistent naming conventions
4. Document service dependencies in manifest

## 2. 📝 Code Quality and Readability

### Strengths ✅
- **TypeScript Usage**: Strong typing in frontend code
- **Zod Schemas**: Comprehensive validation schemas for data models
- **Carbon Design System**: Consistent UI component usage
- **Modern React Patterns**: Hooks, Server Components, proper state management

### Weaknesses ❌
- **High Technical Debt**: 1,775 TODO/FIXME comments indicate deferred work
- **Inconsistent Documentation**: Mix of well-documented and undocumented code
- **Complex Functions**: Some Python files exceed 1000 lines (e.g., `context_analysis.py`: 28KB)
- **Mixed Code Styles**: Python and TypeScript formatting inconsistencies

### Severity Rating: **MEDIUM** 🟡

### Code Complexity Analysis:
```
File                          | Lines | Complexity | Risk
------------------------------|-------|------------|------
context_analysis.py           | ~800  | HIGH       | 🔴

## 3. 🐛 Functionality and Correctness

### Critical Issues 🔴
1. **Missing API Client Package**: `@kyros-praxis/api-client` referenced but doesn't exist
2. **Incomplete Test Coverage**: Only 144 test files for 585K+ lines of code
3. **Placeholder Tests**: `test_placeholder` indicates incomplete testing
4. **Mock-Only Frontend**: Heavy reliance on MSW without real backend integration

### Functional Gaps:
- Agent create/edit wizard not implemented
- Multiple placeholder UI pages
- Authentication system incomplete
- WebSocket connections not properly configured

### Test Coverage Assessment:
```
Component         | Coverage | Status
------------------|----------|--------
Frontend (React)  | <10%     | 🔴 Critical
Backend (FastAPI) | ~20%     | 🔴 Critical
Integration       | <5%      | 🔴 Critical
E2E               | 0%       | 🔴 Critical
```

### Severity Rating: **HIGH** 🔴

- **Virtual Scrolling**: Planned for large datasets

### Weaknesses ❌
- **Large Bundle Size**: Carbon Design System adds significant weight
- **No Performance Monitoring**: Missing APM/observability setup
- **Unoptimized Database Queries**: No query optimization in SQLAlchemy
- **Missing Rate Limiting**: API endpoints lack rate limiting

### Performance Metrics:
```
Metric                | Current | Target | Status

## 5. 🔒 Security and Compliance

### Critical Security Issues 🔴

Based on security audit documentation found:

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**: Direct string interpolation in queries
2. **Weak Password Hashing**: MD5 usage identified in test scenarios
3. **Insecure Session Management**: Predictable session IDs
4. **Missing CSRF Protection**: No CSRF tokens in forms
5. **Debug Mode Enabled**: Production configs with DEBUG=True
6. **Hardcoded Secrets**: Secret keys in configuration files
7. **SSRF Vulnerabilities**: Unvalidated URL fetching
8. **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Unescaped user input rendering

### Security Configuration Issues:
```typescript
// next.config.js - CSP allows unsafe-inline styles
"style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",  // 🔴 XSS risk
"connect-src 'self' http://localhost:8000", // 🔴 Non-HTTPS in production
```

### Compliance Gaps:
- No GDPR compliance measures
- Missing audit logging
- No data encryption at rest
- Insufficient access controls
